# Artificial Generative Intelligence Chatbot using Natural Language Processing

Welcome to the Artificial Generative Intelligence Chatbot project! This innovative chatbot utilizes neural networks to provide intelligent responses. Here's a brief overview of the technical aspects and how it works:

## Technical Details:

- **Language Used:** Python.
- **Backend:** Utilizes Flask for the web application.
- **Neural Network:** Trained with PyTorch, NLTK for natural language understanding.
- **Data:** Trained on a custom dataset defined in `intents.json`.
- **User Interface:** Designed with a responsive and aesthetic chatbox using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure:

- **app.py:** Main Flask application file handling web requests.
- **chat.py:** Core logic for generating responses based on user input.
- **model.py:** Definition of the NeuralNet class for the chatbot model.
- **nltk_utils.py:** Utility functions for tokenizing and bag-of-words representation.
- **intents.json:** Custom dataset defining user intents and responses.
- **train.py:** Python file for training your own model.

## Usage:

1. Run `app.py` to start the Flask server.
2. Access the chatbot at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
3. Enter messages in the chatbox to interact with the chatbot.
4. This Chatbot is made specifically for Artificial Generative Intelligence, so you will get answer only related to it.
5. Screenshots are also given for the visualization.

## Customization:

- Modify the CSS styles in `index.html` to customize the chatbox appearance.

Feel free to explore and enhance the project based on your requirements. Happy Chatting!
